# PHINFGM

## Environment configuration

This project uses Anaconda + Python3.7
Several Python packages required to run the project, in requirements.txt<br>
These Python packages can be installed using Pip or Conda as shown in the following example：<br>
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```

***

***There are three folders***<br>

**1.Input folder：**
A folder containing four datasets：<br>
* Dataset Ⅰ:728_129
* Dataset Ⅱ:32_119
* Dataset Ⅲ:312_747
* Dataset Ⅳ:1380_221<br>

Each data set contains phage-host interactions, phage-phage similarity, and host-host similarity

**2.Embedding folder：**
There are also four folders for four data sets, and each folder contains the Node2Vec Embeddings file generated for each fold of the training data


**3.Novel_VHI folder：**
There are also four folders for each of the four data sets to write to the new PHIs

***
***Python file***
* load_datasets.py-->Read input data, including interaction and similarity
* get_Embedding_FV.py--> Read the inserts generated by Node2vec and get the FV for each phage and host (CV random seed = 22)
* training_functions.py-->Used for several training and processing functions, such as edgeList, Cosine_similarity,..
* pathScores_functions.py-->Calculates and returns all path scores for the path structure
* snf_code.py-->Similarity network fusion function
* PHIs_Main_ada.py-->main（3）
